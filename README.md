# JVM2WASM / JVM2CPP

This is a compiler from Java, Kotlin and any other JVM-language to WebAssembly (WASM) and C++ for [Rem's Engine](https://github.com/AntonioNoack/RemsEngine)'s web port.
It has a [garbage collector](src/jvm/GarbageCollector.java), and [JavaScript bindings for OpenGL via OpenGL ES](src/jvm/LWJGLxOpenGL.java).
The target JVM language version is Java 8 (lambdas).

With optional exception handling, a manual stack is created, where the stack-trace is tracked.
This decreases performance if enabled.

The generated C++ currently is more focussed on working than being beautiful.
It's a planned feature to use structs and such.

## Demos
- [Snake](https://remsengine.phychi.com/jvm2wasm/snake/) (on a repeating, infinite grid)
- [Rem's Engine](https://remsengine.phychi.com/jvm2wasm/editor/) (mainly interesting for render modes at the moment)

## Main class
The main class for translation is [JVM2WASM.kt](src/JVM2WASM.kt) and [JVM2CPP.kt](src/wasm2cpp/JVM2CPP.kt).
[JVM2WASM](src/JVM2WASM.kt) controls, where class indexing should start,
and which classes shall be replaced by others (to reduce total executable size).

## Quirks
- I replaced the java.lang.String contents with UTF-8, because that's more sensible imo and saves memory.
- There is only a single thread. It cannot sleep, because that's impossible in JavaScript.
- There is only asynchronous IO via JavaScript bindings, because JavaScript has no synchronous IO, or it shouldn't be used, because that would block the UI thread.
- My Java-8 implementation is lackluster in relation to lambdas: I only support Java-native lambdas.
- It is precompiled, so at runtime, classes are immutable, and no additional .jars can be loaded.
- Reflection is partially supported: constructors, methods and fields exist if they are used. Methods only if they have few arguments (because I haven't solved it programmatically yet). Annotations for anything else but fields aren't supported yet.
- The Java standard library is only available in parts. Native methods have to be implemented by hand.
- Like the creators of Zig and Rust, I find the complexity of Throwables problematic. Since this is meant for shipping games, you should implement your methods without Throwables, and then just keep them disabled.
- I disabled Regex and replaced Kotlin's reflection library, because they are huge, and I only use fractions of them. Regex is badly readable anyway ^^. If you want Regex back, best use the JS-implementation to save on extra code.

## Runtime
The runtime is defined in [index.js](src/index.js). It is defined like that for Rem's Engine.
It calls into [Engine.java](src/engine/Engine.java), first main() and then update() is called every frame. MouseMove(), keyDown() etc are called on their respective DOM-events.

wasm/index0.js is the file of JavaScript bindings, that is automatically generated from the source code.
Entries can be added using the @JavaScript(code="") annotation within Java source code. If a method is missing,
but depended on, e.g., because it is native to the JVM or blacklisted, it will throw an exception if called.
@Alias(name="") can be used to make the function name on the JavaScript side explicit and shorter, or to implement such a blacklisted method:
just use the same name, and it will be used as an implementation.
@Alias(name="") may also be used to override existing methods, e.g., to simplify its behaviour, extend it, replace its implementation (e.g., with a JS library), or similar.
@WASM(code="") can be used for inline assembly.

Notice that methods implemented in @JavaScript need an extra return value for the potential exception (if they are enabled)!
Use @NoThrow to mark your method as safe.

Example (*with the idea that the original implementation was overkill for our needs*):
```java
@NoThrow
@Alias(name = "java_lang_Character_isDigit_IZ")
public static boolean Character_isDigit(int code) {
    return unsignedLessThan(code - '0', 10);
}

@NoThrow
@WASM(code = "i32.lt_u")
public static native boolean unsignedLessThan(int a, int b);
```

## WASM2CPP

For running my engine in pure C++ environments, I also created a transpiler from WASM text to C++. The performance is fine, running
at 312 fps on my Ryzen 7950x3D with lots of security features disabled (max-performance mode), and rendering testSceneWithUI() with a medium-poly sphere.
The same program runs at 308 fps in Java, so practically a tie.

The benefit of C++ over WASM is that jumps are supported natively, so there isn't much overhead for them.
This can be observed when the GPU isn't used much: just rendering the color of the sphere results in ~1700 fps in C++ and ~900 fps in Java.
Also, you might have an easier time connecting to native APIs, reducing the bridge code necessary compared to Java Native Interface (JNI).

The standard-library for running in C++ is pretty bare-bones at the moment, not being able to load files, not having network access, and having no font mechanism except the engine fallback (7-segment-like).

This C++-"port" should allow the engine to be compiled to any OS. There also isn't much "++" about it, most could be easily converted to C.

## Garbage Collector
The following section discusses my implemented garbage collectors, where performance has been tested in my C++-transpiled native environment
on a Ryzen 7950x3D (one of the fastest CPUs available at this time).

### Serial GC

Serial GC is too slow: when it runs every frame, it reduces the FPS to 40 on my system. When it runs every X frames,
the large accumulated backlog of old instances creates a large lag spike (200ms/50MB, X = 2000, from 50MB down to 20MB).
It has the advantage of not accumulating new memory during collection.

### Parallel GC

C++ offers multi-threading, so I experimented with a parallely running GC: finding the largest gaps, which is the most expensive step,
can be executed in parallel. The implementation is currently a little instable, crashing after 18,000 iterations in a stability test (when triggering GC every frame).
Running GC every 2000 frames at 60 fps should be stable enough though (92+ hours runtime).

### Concurrent GC

Inspired by the parallel GC crashing during development, I also developed a concurrent garbage collector:
the load is spread out over multiple frames, reducing FPS slightly (5ms first frame, ~1ms/frame) for a few frames, for a second.
It only crashed after 236,000 iterations (why ever). This is the best choice for stability and performance.

### System Information

- **Java Version**: 1.8.0_402 Corretto (Amazon.com Inc.)
- **OS**: Windows 10 (10.0.19045, amd64)
- **Memory**: 32GB DDR5 4800 MT/s
- **CPU**: Ryzen 9 7950x3D
- **Chrome**: 125.0.6422.60 (outdated by a few months)

Test run in a regular engine build, 2025/03/27 on *abf3660e18cc583710b77943e78db881b7d79dda*.
Running the performance tests in the JDK somehow gets it stuck in measureMonteCarlo with the normal run mode ðŸ¤”.
It finished in debug-mode though, which is why I used the JDK debug-mode for my results.

### Compilation times (JRE + Rem's Engine)
Translating JVM bytecode to C++ and WAT and WASM takes 10-12 seconds (without static-init at compile-time, that is three seconds on top).
Compiling the debug C++ build currently takes roughly five seconds using MSVC, and release build takes thirty seconds.

## Used Libraries / Dependencies
- [ObjectWeb ASM 9.3](https://asm.ow2.io/)
- [Rem's Engine](https://github.com/AntonioNoack/RemsEngine)

The system was developed for a sun-based JVM.
I have implemented stubs for a few methods like `sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass()` and `sun.misc.VM.isSystemDomainLoader()`.
Other JVMs might implement different backends for classes like java.nio.?Buffer, and might need stubs or implementations for them, too.

## Planned features (TODOs)

The following TODOs are also sorted by priority, so I'll likely implement the first ones first.
Anyone is welcome to contribute to these topics.

- Port the engine to my Meta Quest 3
- Create nice-looking JavaScript/TypeScript
- Create nice-looking C++ with structs as classes
- Implement proper file IO for C++ to load assets
- Integrate this into Rem's Engine's export feature, so you can create WASM-builds from within editor
- Use WASM-throwables
- Extract temporary instances to an additional stack somehow, so we save its allocations?
- Implement stack traces in C++ using the actual stack, so having much less performance overhead, but still Throwables
- Implement stack traces in WASM using the stack???
